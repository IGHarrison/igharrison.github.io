  <h1>Dear Prospective Client,</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I’m Isaiah, a computer engineering student. I’m looking for a long term freelancing gig. I need 
    money to support my schooling. It’s one reason why I’m freelancing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let me be blunt. I don’t have any working experience. I didn’t undergo on-the-job training
    yet. I know I might be disinteresting you now but let me explain why I might be still worth a shot. If 
    you checked my portfolio, you can see that I am capable. I still have value. I might not have any experience
    but my skills are still the real deal. Let me give you a rundown on my work and how I work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s start with CoffeeIO. I know, it sounds pretentious. It’s just a website for ordering coffee online. 
    Though pretentious it may be, you can see how capable I am with HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript. Vanilla
    Javascript is another for pure Javascript without the use of libraries. CoffeeIO takes orders plus includes
    an algorithm that produces the shortest route possible for faster deliveries. Coffee is love, coffee is life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next to CoffeeIO is an online journal. It is made with the jQuery library for slick animations and Node.js
    for data storage. This shows how capable I am with the “fancy stuff”. Making this stuff was kind of hard.
    Ideas keeping popping in my brain. I listed down all those features so that I could concentrate. Only a 
    quarter were implemented. I only picked features that I can implement easily and those that will align 
    with its purpose. I only scratched the surface of my abilities. I know I can do better. I’m eager to improve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then we have the miscellaneous stuff, I won’t go over the small details since most of it is self-explanatory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let’s talk about our goals as a team — What you can expect from me and what I expect from you as my employer.
    I will do my best to deliver. I will work hard on any project you give me. If I encounter any trouble, I will
    try to solve it first. Research it if I can’t. Asking you will be my last option. Rest assured. I won’t bother 
    you until I feel the need to. I will only ask you if I need confirmation regarding the project and my salary &#128513. My
    minimum per hour is $5. I’m not going any lower. If you don’t like it, you’re always free to pick a cheaper option.
    You also need to pay me weekly especially if it’s our first time working together. If you’re good with these
    conditions, then I’m looking forward to working with you.
  </p>
