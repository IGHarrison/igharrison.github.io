  <h1>Dear Prospective Client,</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Isaiah. I’m studying Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I haven’t graduated
    yet because of financial reasons. It’s one reason why I’m doing freelancing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I don’t have any experience working under companies. You might have doubts hiring me after reading
    that. Before you judge, check out my portfolio. These projects show my capability even without 
    working experience. I earned my experience by building these projects. Check out CoffeeIO. I know,
    sounds high tech for something that lets you order coffee online. Though the name might be pretentious,
    it is something I worked hard on. It something I loved making since I’m also a coffee lover. Checking
    under the hood shows how adept my skill in vanilla Javascript. If you don’t know what vanilla Javascript
    is, vanilla Javascript is another term for pure Javascript, not using libraries or frameworks (fancy tools).
    So? It shows that I have a good foundation of Javascript. Javascript is still evolving. From my point of
    view, I only scratched the surface. I still have to dig deeper to understand the entirety of Javascript.
  </p>

    My second project, an online journal, is using a library “the fancy stuff”. Not only do I have
    a good foundation of Javascript. I can use libraries as well. I used a library since I wanted the journal
    to be mobile-friendly. One thing that makes libraries popular is their ability to deploy mobile-friendly
    sites with only a few lines of code. Libraries make things easier. In this case, using Javascript easier.
